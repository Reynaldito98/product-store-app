This project simulates a small store where the user is the seller and the buyer at the same time. The user could sell clothes as well as other items and add them to a cart and 
purchase them too. This is a Full-Stack application created with React and Node.js. An API was created using the Node.js framework Express.js, and MongoDB. You could also delete 
items from the list of products or from the cart and update the product info.
